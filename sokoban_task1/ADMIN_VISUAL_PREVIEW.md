## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **File Modified:**
`lib/sokoban_task1_web/live/admin_live.ex`

### **Key Changes:**

#### 1. **Updated Preview Section**
```elixir
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-800 to-gray-900 p-6 rounded-lg overflow-auto flex justify-center items-center min-h-[200px]">
  <%= render_board_preview(assigns) %>
</div>
```
- Dark background (like game board)
- Centered display
- Responsive overflow handling

#### 2. **Added `render_board_preview/1` Function**
Renders the board as an HTML grid:
- Iterates through each row with `Enum.with_index`
- Splits each row into individual cells
- Applies CSS classes based on cell type
- Uses the same `cell` CSS classes as the game

#### 3. **Added `get_preview_cell_classes/4` Function**
Determines the correct CSS class for each cell:
- `"#"` → `"wall"` (purple gradient)
- `"@"` → `"player"` (player icon with glow)
- `"$"` → `"box"` (box image)
- `"."` → `"goal"` (green marker)
- `" "` → `"empty"` (transparent)

#### 4. **Added `cell_symbol/1` Helper**
Returns empty string for all cells (visuals only, no text symbols)

#### 5. **Updated `generate_board_preview/1`**
Now returns the board array directly instead of joining to string
